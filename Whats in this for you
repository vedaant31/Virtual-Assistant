We made a  program that understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for a user. Three such real-life applications are Siri on Apple devices, Cortana on Microsoft Devices and Google Assistant on Android devices.
We tried creating a mini version of 'ALEXA' that performs these significant functions and takes command from the user, for example, playing a song, displaying the current time and recognising famous personalities from Wikipedia. Also, changed it to a female voice.
 The following libraries were used :

	1	speech_recognition 
	2	pyttsx3
	3	pywhatkit
	4	datetime
	5	wikipedia
	6	pyjokes
